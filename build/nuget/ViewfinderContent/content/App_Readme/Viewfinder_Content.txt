 Home\
   Mobile\
     Android\
       Index.cshtml
     iOS\
       Index.cshtml

 Shared\
   _Layout.Viewfinder.cshtml

The _Layout.Viewfinder.cshtml contains reference to the MS CDN for jQuery Mobile.  For more information on the project, please check out the project's GitHub site: https://github.com/lozanotek/viewfinder
